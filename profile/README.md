# zig-gamedev

Originally spawned in July 2021 by [Michal Ziulek](https://github.com/michal-z). We build a game development ecosystem for the [Zig programming language and toolchain](https://ziglang.org/)

* [Cross-platform and composable libraries](https://github.com/zig-gamedev/zig-gamedev#Libraries)
* [Cross-platform sample applications](https://github.com/zig-gamedev/zig-gamedev#sample-applications-native-wgpu)
* [DirectX 12 sample applications](https://github.com/zig-gamedev/zig-gamedev#sample-applications-directx-12)

## Vision
* Very modular toolbox of libraries
* Zig is the only prerequisit to build on Windows, macOS and Linux; no platform specific libraries or build tools need to be installed
* Libraries are written from scratch in Zig *or* provide bindings for carefully selected C/C++ libraries
